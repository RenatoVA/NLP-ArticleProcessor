If there are\\nmultiple blocking components, streaming begins after the last one.\\n\\nPlease note: RunnableLambdas do not support `transform` by default! So if\\n    you need to use a RunnableLambdas be careful about where you place them in a\\n    RunnableSequence (if you need to use the .stream()/.astream() methods).\\n\\n    If you need arbitrary logic and need streaming, you can subclass\\n    Runnable, and implement `transform` for whatever logic you need.\\n\\nHere is a simple example that uses simple functions to illustrate the use of\\nRunnableSequence:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: python\\n\\n        from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda\\n\\n        def add_one(x: int) -> int:\\n            return x + 1\\n\\n        def mul_two(x: int) -> int:\\n            return x * 2\\n\\n        runnable_1 = RunnableLambda(add_one)\\n        runnable_2 = RunnableLambda(mul_two)\\n        sequence = runnable_1 | runnable_2\\n        # Or equivalently:\\n        # sequence = RunnableSequence(first=runnable_1, last=runnable_2)\\n        sequence.invoke(1)\\n        await sequence.ainvoke(1)\\n\\n        sequence.batch([1, 2, 3])\\n        await sequence.abatch([1, 2, 3])\\n\\nHere's an example that uses streams JSON output generated by an LLM:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: python\\n\\n        from langchain_core.output_parsers.json import SimpleJsonOutputParser\\n        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n\\n        prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\\n            'In JSON format, give me a list of {topic} and their '\\n            'corresponding names in French, Spanish and in a '\\n            'Cat Language.'\\n        )\\n\\n        model = ChatOpenAI()\\n        chain = prompt | model | SimpleJsonOutputParser()\\n\\n        async for chunk in chain.astream({'topic': 'colors'}):\\n            print('-')  # noqa: T201\\n            print(chunk, sep='', flush=True)  # noqa: T201\",\n",
